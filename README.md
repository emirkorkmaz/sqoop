Workouts with Sqoop2

## Import Data to HDFS from MySQL  
Using Sqoop2 for importing data to HDFS is actually pretty simple. All you need is connector, links and a job -and the shell too :) -.  
  
* Connect to the sqoop2 shell  

* Check the connectors, we need built-in generic jdbc and hdfs connectors  

* Create a link to HDFS specifying the address of our HDFS cluster  

* Create a link to relational database -mysql for our case- specifying the data to be fetched  

* Create a job  

* Check the status  

* Check HDFS
